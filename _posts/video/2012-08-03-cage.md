Music by Anton Batagov.  
Video by Alisa Naremontti.  

This composition consists of a pre-recorded audio and an instrumental score. The recording of street sounds was made on the corner of 6th Avenue and 18th Street near the building where John Cage lived. This audio has no overdubs and no effects. It sounds exactly as it was recorded. John Cage himself could have heard these sounds from the window of his apartment... The score written for strings and piano is an interplay of the notes C-A-G-E and the numbers -- the date of his birth: day, month, year, Century.
