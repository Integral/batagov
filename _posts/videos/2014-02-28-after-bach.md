The first ever documentary about Russian minimalist composers.  

The portraits of four composers - Vladimir Martynov, Anton Batagov, Pavel Karmanov, Sergei Zagny - the new classics of Russian contemporary music.  

Their discussions about post-Soviet Russia, about the decline of Russian culture, about the consumption-based civilization and its primitive values.  

This film is an attempt to see modern world with these composers' eyes, to hear it with their ears. It is much more difficult to be a composer in the 21st Century than Centuries ago. Is it really possible to be heard today?
