> Anton Batagov evokes Richter, and his own playing reaches the zone that Richter aims for.

_Allan Evans_

> A surgical precision of his piano touch, deeply sensible sound that blooms in all colors under his fingers… Anton Batagov is a unique composer/performer who cannot be compared to anyone else because he is one of a kind.
