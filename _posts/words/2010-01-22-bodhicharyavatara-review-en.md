One might ask – what could be common among American blues-rock, medieval ballads, and Buddhist chanting? Normally, one might be tempted to answer – of course, nothing – but strangely enough, an intersection between these parallel musical planes does exist in the figure of Anton Batagov. I would never have believed this possible, but here on this CD is a recording in which Batagov effortlessly creates such an amalgam of musical cultures with his own hands. Telo Tulku Rinpoche is materialised on this disk by voices alone.

It is an amazing recording that evokes a truly magical effect. An effect so strong, that when I played it for the first time, I accidentally hit the continuous play button and found myself listening to it uninterrupted for several hours. I didn’t even notice the passage of time as I had entered an alternative space where not only time, but everything around me had risen into a previously unknown reality. It likewise affected others around me – a phenomenon that I checked a few times. Even after repeated listenings, no one asked me to turn it off.

Almost four months have passed since I received this recording and in this period it has been played countless times, often copied for my friends, and remains among those recordings that I listen to continuously. Incredible! I just couldn’t write about it for the “Rezultaty”! Every time I grab the disk I cannot stop listening, and I completely forget about writing! What an unusual effect…

Today, I came to my office and accidentally left the CD at home. Unexpectedly I wrote these brief impressions you are reading now.
