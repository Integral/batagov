This 60-minute composition is based on selected chapters from the famous poem [BODHICHARYĀVATĀRA](http://www.batagov.com/slova/bodhicharyavatara_text_e.htm) (_The Way of the Bodhisattva_), composed by the eighth-century Indian master Shantideva. The vocal part is chanted by Telo Tulku Rinpoche, _The Shajin-Lama_ (Supreme Lama) of Kalmykia. At the age of seven he was recognized by the Dalai Lama as the current reincarnation of Tilopa (988 - 1069), a great Buddhist saint. Amazingly, Rinpoche's traditional Tibetan-style chanting sounds almost like a rock vocal. In the original music written by Anton Batagov, stylistic patterns from renaissance ballads and minimalism, Tibetan ritual music and rock, chamber/symphonic textures and modern jazz, constitute a seamless unity. Telo Tulku Rinpoche has said about the music: _"It's not just a meditation music. It's a real drama which leads a listener towards deeper understanding of a heroic path of the Bodhisattvas, those who vow to become enlightened in order to help all beings awaken into the state of freedom and fulfillment"_.
