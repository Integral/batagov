A long journey of sounds, travels and prayers led to this musical experiment coming to fruition, and I am so thankful to all who have participated in making it happen. When I was a child in Tibet, my mother taught me how the Medicine Buddha’s Prayer could be a vehicle for making all sentient beings healthy inside and out, and the song we have recorded with that title draws upon this timeless theme.
 
I hope that all who listen to this album will benefit from our musical collaboration, as a reminder of how a profound personal and spiritual transformation are still possible in these times.
 
_Yungchen Lhamo_

Please play this whole album without interruption, because it's a trip that has its special trajectory. In a way, it’s like a modern vocal cycle—a continuation of the old traditions: Schubert, Mahler, Mussorgsky, Prokofiev.

A wanderer from Schubert's Winterreise sings about loneliness, death and illusory hope. We are the 21st-century wanderers. The world is much crazier today than it was 200 years ago. No matter where we were born, what language we speak, what words we use for prayers, we make our way through this crazy world, and we are still hoping that good times will come.

_Anton Batagov_
