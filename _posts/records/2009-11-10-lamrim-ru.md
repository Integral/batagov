The success of any spiritual practice depends entirely on a disciple's ability to defeat his ego and completely subordinate himself to his spiritual master. This is an axiom accepted by all world religions.

In this prayer a practitioner chants the names of all those enlightened masters who have been the holders of the Buddhist tradition for 25 centuries, and asks them to bestow their blessing. The list begins with the name of Buddha Shakyamuni, and ends with the name of a living lama.

Yeshe Lodoi Rinpoche, one of today's greatest Buddhist teachers, told me that he'd like to record this prayer and asked me to write an instrumental arrangement. He said that it would make it easier for modern practitioners to sing it with an arrangement. I am extremely grateful to him for this blessing.

The prayer was recorded in May'2009. Rinpoche chants the first part of the prayer, and Geshe Lharamba Tenzin, his closest disciple, joins him in the second part.

When I began listening to this recording I realized that it would need no composer's intervention like that one which I dared do in "The Monk Thogmey's Thirty-Seven Precepts" and "Bodhicharyāvatāra". It would be wrong to add any sounds that would turn this recording into a composer's work. I added just a few chords accompanying the vocal part. I hope these sounds would help to emphasize the amazing combination of fathomless depth, sincere warmth and profound expression which fills every word of this prayer and every note of this simple melody.

When a disciple is listening to his guru or thinking of him he weeps. There is no rational explanation of this phenomenon. It has nothing to do with sentimentality or any other ordinary emotion, but these tears are able to unlock a door to the ultimate truth which cannot be understood intellectually. Unfortunately it is difficult for us to feel like this. Even when we are listening to a monastic chants we listen either with professional musician's (or critic's) ears or with a music lover's ears. However, I'd like you to hear this recording in a different way. When a great lama and his closest disciple who is a lama himself are praying to all the gurus who have been transmitting the unbroken lineage of the Teaching from the Buddha to the present times their emotions are as strong as the emotions of a young boy who has just come to the monastery. No spiritual path is possible without this emotion, and only this intensive feeling can help us overcome any obstacles and sufferings. When I was working on this arrangement I tried to be a disciple, not a composer. I would be happy to transmit this feeling to everyone who is listening to this recording.
