Unless one sees the Buddha in one's mind, Nirvana is obscured.  
Although the Wisdom of Nirvana and the Ignorance of the Samsara illusorily appear to be two things, they cannot truly be differentiated.  
It is an error to conceive them otherwise than as one.  
Erring and non-erring are, intrinsically, also a unity.  
By not taking the mind to be naturally a duality, and allowing it, as the primordial consciousness, to abide in its own place, beings attain deliverance.  
The error of doing otherwise than this arises not from Ignorance in the mind itself, but from not having sought to know the nature of mind.  
Seek within thine own self-illuminated, self-originated mind whence, firstly, all such concepts arise, secondly, where they exist, and, lastly, whither they vanish.  
  
_(Guru Padmasambhava.  
Self-Liberation Through Seeing With Naked Awareness)_
